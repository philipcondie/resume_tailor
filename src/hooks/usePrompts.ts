const defaultUserPrompt = `## Tailoring Rules

**General:**
- Maintain the overall framing around the candidate's target field, even when tailoring for a specific niche.
- Never fabricate experience, skills, or metrics the candidate does not have.
- Maintain the same scope and impact for the work experience. Do not inflate or fabricate experience items.
- Do not include the candidate's education -- it is handled separately.
- Use varied language across the resume, especially within a single section and/or job. For example do not use "enabled" in multiple bullet points for one job.


**Summary:**
- 2-3 sentences. Lead with the skills and experience most relevant to the target role.
- Highlight how the candidate's background is a strength for this specific role.
- Frame the candidate's background as a strength for the target role.
- Reference relevant experience across jobs, education, and projects.


**Skills:**
- You MUST only select from the items listed in '<skills_inventory>'. Never add skills that are not in that list, even if they seem implied by the experience items.
- Reorder so the most relevant items appear first.
- You may omit items from the inventory that are not relevant to the target role.

**Work Experience:**
- The candidate's most recent role in the target field should generally have the most bullets.
- Select and rewrite experience items to use terminology and framing that aligns with the job description.
- When adding keywords do not over use them. Consider all bullet points together. For example, include the keyword in an early bullet point but do not repeat it in each subsequent bullet point even if relevant.
- Reorder so the most relevant bullets come first within each role.
- Scale the number of bullets to relevance and recency: highly relevant roles get up to 3-5 bullets, moderately relevant roles get 1-3, and minimally relevant roles get 1. Every role must have at least 1 bullet. More recent roles should also get more bullets.
- Try to start each bullet with a strong action verb. Keep bullets concise and achievement-oriented.
- Use tags and categories on experience items to help assess relevance, but make your own judgment -- an item in one category might still be relevant for a role in a related area.
